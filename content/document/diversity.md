### Professionalism, Diversity and Inclusion Statement

Our intent is that this course provides a welcoming and inclusive environment that is free of any form of discrimination and harassment. All members of our community, including the students, TAs, faculty, and staff, are expected to treat one another in a professional and respectful manner. Our TAs have undergone training in diversity and inclusion. If you feel you have not been treated in a professional or respectful manner by any of the course staff, please contact either the course instructors, our [DGS](https://www.math.brown.edu/~sswatson/), or the Graduate School. We will take all complaints about unprofessional behavior seriously.

Here are some related resources:

* [Title IX site](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/title-ix/index.php?q=policy)
* [Office of Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-diversity/)
* [Health Services](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/health/services/)


Please note that all of the course staff and the [DGS](https://www.math.brown.edu/~sswatson/) are what Title IX call Responsible Employees. If you report a title violation to any of these people, they are required to report it to the university, in which case you will be contacted by a university official. Thus, if you want your conversation to be kept strictly confidential, you should talk to one of the many resources listed here. Note that Brown's [SHARE Advocates](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/health/services/promotion/sexual-assault-dating-violence-get-help-how-help-friend/share-advocates) offer confidentiality.
