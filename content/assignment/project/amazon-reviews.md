You can download the notebook over [here](/notebook/fake-reviews.ipynb).

## Motivation

Can we trust Amazon reviews? If Walmart were to have a review system as good as
Yelp's, would it be able to push back against Amazon?

## Getting the data
    public datasets
    web scraping - legality

## Initial Exploration: The orbital shaker

Some people can get away with blatantly fake reviews. How can we combat this?
Why hasn't Amazon filtered out the easy pickings?

## Understanding Context

How are fake reviews made? Who writes the fake reviews? What about these
fake reviewers leads to certain trends about fake reviews?

## More Feature Engineering: Time and wording

Do fake reviews come in batches? How do we know when the wording of a seller and its
competitors reviews indicate likely tampering?

## Putting it together: Naive Bayes

How can we test our "classifier"? 

## Collaborative filtering

Given knowledge of a few fake reviewers and reliant sellers, how can we find more?

## (Extra) Motivation: Yelp

Can we create tags for products with enough reviews? Is the cost worth it for Amazon?
How about a competitor?
