## Music

## Music Data Around Us

Possible datasets:

* Million Song Dataset - Audio Features
* Spotify - General
* Last.fm
* Billboard
* Youtube
* Twitter
* Reddit
* Google Trends
* Blogs
* Critics
* Sales

## Cleaning the data

* Typos everwhere: social media, billboard charts
* Extracting features from tweets, comments, reviews

## Before We Overwork Ourselves

* How well do we need to merge the data?
* What kind of questions are we going to ask?

## Putting it together

* Different album spellings, different artist formats
* LastFM popularity vs Spotify popularity vs Twitter

## Loading the data

* Do we need a staging area?

## Testing our data

How do we feel about our data after some exploration?

## A Second ETL iteration

* Setting SQL Constraints
* Using SQL to identify errors
* Sampling


## Endnote: When will are data stop sucking?

Do we need so much data? Do we already know what the good data is? Time costs,
storage and computing costs, estimated reward.
