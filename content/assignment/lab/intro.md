# Lab 1: Intro to Data Science

Due: 9/8/2017

## Setting up your computer

### Install python3

We recommend the following methods:

* [Linux](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starting/install3/linux/)
* [Mac OS X](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/)
* [Windows](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starting/install3/win/)

It is fine if you already have a different version of Python 3 installed. However, you
may run into errors that we have not come across.

### Downloading the lab files.

Git? Zip file on this page? Brown's filesystem?

```git clone ...```

```ssh username@ssh.cs.brown.edu```

```scp username@ssh.cs.brown.edu:path/to/template .```

```upzip filename```

### Running the notebook

```pip3 install virtualenv ENV```

```source ENV/bin/activate```

```pip3 install requirements.txt```

```jupyter notebook```
